During this project I have demonstrated the fundamentals of html web-development.

Ordered, and unordered lists are displayed on functional recipe pages. Relevant images are displayed for each recipe and setup with available links to and from the homepage. 

This project has definitely helped show how to set a blueprint for a webpage and also in structuring my files in an intuitive way so that my relative links can be navigated with ease. 

Finding free images is still a little unlear, and I will definitely look into the legality/limitations surrounding using images found on the internet.
