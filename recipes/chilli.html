    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 pound 93% lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup beef bone broth, divided</li>
            <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can chili beans, divided</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons mild chili powder</li>
            <li>cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Crumble ground beef into the pot, and cook until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain off any excess liquid. Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Pour in half the bone broth and tomato sauce. Add 1/2 of the chili beans to the pot.</li>
            <li>Pour remaining bone broth and chill beans into a high power blender, such as a Vitamix®. Cover with lid and blend on High power for 30 seconds. Pour blended mixture into the Instant Pot®, but do not stir.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid.  Select high pressure according to manufacturer’s instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer’s instructions, about 5 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer’s instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. </li>
            <li>Season with chili powder and stir to combine. Divide evenly into 4 bowls. Garnish with Cheddar cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
